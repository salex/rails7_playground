# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 7.0.3

* System dependencies slim-rails


* ...

This is just a simple test app to try things out, help others solve problems etc.

I may point to some part of the app if I need to allow someone to view a problem or solution.

Some this in here are
